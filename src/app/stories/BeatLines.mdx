# `BeatLines` is an SVG component

It's important to understand that SVG components are used to improve rendering
performance. In the case of `BeatLines` and `Clip`, SVG is rendered and set to
ignore aspect ratio so that the image will resize naturally and quickly.

In some cases, however, we want to preserve aspect ratio for some things while
ignoring it for others. For example, we want to ignore the aspect ratio for the
space between the beat lines but would like to keep the lines themselves at 1px.
This isn't possible with SVG, however it has been approximated in the code by
setting different line widths for different size ranges.

## Important

`BeatLines` must share the same `width` as other components on the same
timeline.
