# `Clip` is an SVG component

It's important to understand that SVG components are used to improve rendering
performance. In the case of `BeatLines` and `Clip`, SVG is rendered and set to
ignore aspect ratio so that the image will resize naturally and quickly.

In some cases, however, we want to preserve aspect ratio for some things while
ignoring it for others. For example, we want to ignore the aspect ratio for the
notes in the clip but would like to keep the clip borders fixed. This isn't
possible with SVG so `Clip` uses a mix of HTML for the containing element and
SVG for the body.

## Important

`Clip` will expand to fit its container and should be housed in a container that
shares the same `width` as other components on the same timeline. This is
because there is only 1 `Clip` per track at the moment.
